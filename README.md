# co2emission-multipleRegressionML
- The data set used for prediaction is FuelConsumption which contains columns like engine size,cylinders,fuel consumption and co2 emission.
- Importing the libraries that are needed and ploting scatter plots to find the column which is more linear with respect to co2 emission.
- The data is split into train and test data and sklearn is used to find the cofficients for linear regression.
- Finally concluding by displaying the errors and R square value.
